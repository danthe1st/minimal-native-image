# Minimal native-image

This project attempts to create a Docker image of a Hello World application which is as small as possible.

This is heavily inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wYrAtngIVo) where the same has been demonstrated.

You can view it [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/dan1st/hello-world-native-java) on Docker Hub.
